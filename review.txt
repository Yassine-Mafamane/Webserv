When a client gets disconected, instead of passing it s ident to delete it. You just can pass it s client_info object. Thus no need to search for the right client. But be carefull because the clients objects are stored in a vector inside the socketManager! 

If creating the client request or responce fails when allocating, just delete the client object and no need to store it in the event queue.

In the event loop better use a switch case statement instead of if else.

Add the alias directive inside location.

Allow GET by default.

If version is HTTP/1.1, the host header is mandatory!

The client has to get bounced off in case of a bad request!

(Nginx) After parsing the start line if the final target is /.. the request is concidered bad (400)

In case of a redirection for example return 404, if the string to show is empty return the 404 error page.

Paths in the config file must be normalized for example the following //;

Redirection of an error page must be as following : if the code is a redirection code then send the string as location don t wory if the location is empty because it happens in nginx as well. Else if it s an error code, if the string isn t empty the send the string as body else send the provided error page else send the default one.

The HEAD Method!
